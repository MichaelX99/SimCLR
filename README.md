# SimCLR Implementation
This is my personal implementation of SimCLR.  In addition I am testing out the use of Jax so the plan is to be able to use Jax or Pytorch to run SimCLR.

# Host Dependencies
1. CUDA 10.x https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive
1. Docker https://docs.docker.com/install/
2. Nvidia-Docker https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker

# Backlog
* Move the Jax dependency out of only the docker image to the setup.py
